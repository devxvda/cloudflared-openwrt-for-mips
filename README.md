# Cloudflare Tunnel Client (cloudflared) for MIPS Devices

This repo has a version of cloudflared (Cloudflare Tunnel client) that works on MIPS-based devices running OpenWrt, like the TP-Link MR-3020.

## What’s Inside?

- A cloudflared continues build for MIPS devices.
- Automatic updates using GitHub Actions, so always up-to-date.

## How It Works

- Every day at 00:00, a [GitHub Actions job](https://github.com/devxvda/cloudflared-openwrt-for-mips/actions) will be checks if there’s a new version of [official Cloudflared releases](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest).  
- If there’s an update, it compiles the new version and drops it in the [Releases](https://github.com/devxvda/cloudflared-openwrt-for-mips/releases/latest).
